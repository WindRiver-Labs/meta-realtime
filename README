meta-realtime
=============

This layer is intended to be a central point for realtime related kernel and
system development. It also contains utilities, and configuration useful for
tuning a realtime system. It should be useful directly on top of oe-core.  It
should be primarily useful to the following groups:

      - Anyone working on Linux kernel realtime development (preempt-rt, 
        sched_dealine, posix realtime).

      - Anyone experimenting with alternative pairing of general purpose 
        OSs and realtime OS divisions. Whether that be AMP, userspace RTOS
        or realtime hypervisors.

      - Anyone working on cpu isolation, system partitioning and related userspace
        applications.

      - Anyone benchmarking and performance profiling a Linux system.
